- Preserve all existing service cards.
- Preserve working modals and links.
- Preserve Voice, GPS and Emergency systems.
- Never invent government URLs or emergency contacts.
- Never expose API keys or credentials.
- Keep backup branch unchanged.
- Make one safe change at a time.

## Next Task

Create a dynamic multilingual service search index
using existing website service cards and Google Sheets.

Do not delete existing search files yet.
